üß© Entity Relationship Overview
The api-user microservice includes two main domain entities: User and Role, which are designed following a normalized relational model to ensure consistency and integrity.

üîó Entity Relationship
A User is associated with exactly one Role.

A Role can be assigned to many Users.

This is a classic many-to-one relationship from User to Role.

## Project organization

The code is organized as follows:

1. `configuration` contains all the external library implementations to be configured inside spring-boot.
2. `controller` contains the communication interfaces with the client.
3. `entity` contains the persistence domains.
4. `dto` contains classes that separate in-memory objects from the database.
5. `mapper` contains mapping classes between objects and entities.
6. `repository` contains the classes or components that encapsulate the logic necessary to access the data sources.
7. `service` contains the interfaces and implementations that define the functionality provided by the service.
8. `utils` contains application utils classes.
