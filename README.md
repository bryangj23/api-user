üß© Entity Relationship Overview
The api-user microservice includes two main domain entities: User and Role, which are designed following a normalized relational model to ensure consistency and integrity.

üîó Entity Relationship
A User is associated with exactly one Role.

A Role can be assigned to many Users.

This is a classic many-to-one relationship from User to Role.

+------------+       Many-to-One       +------------+
|   Users    |------------------------>|   Roles    |
+------------+                        +------------+
| id         |                        | id         |
| userNumber |                        | code       |
| email      |                        | name       |

3. `entity` contains the persistence domains.
4. `dto` contains classes that separate in-memory objects from the database.
5. `mapper` contains mapping classes between objects and entities.
